NAME
    Pod::Readme - Convert POD to README file

REQUIREMENTS
    This module should run on Perl 5.005 or newer. The following non-core
    modules (depending on your Perl version) are required:

      Pod::Text
      Test::More

INSTALLATION
    Installation can be done using the traditional Makefile.PL or the newer
    Build.PL methods.

    Using Makefile.PL:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make test
      make install

    (On Windows platforms you should use "nmake" instead.)

    Using Build.PL (if you have Module::Build installed):

      perl Build.PL
      perl Build test
      perl Build install

SYNOPSIS
      use Pod::Readme;
      my $parser = Pod::Readme->new();

      # Read POD from STDIN and write to STDOUT
      $parser->parse_from_filehandle;

      # Read POD from Module.pm and write to README
      $parser->parse_from_file('Module.pm', 'README');

DESCRIPTION
    This module is a subclass of Pod::PlainText which provides additional
    POD markup for generating README files.

    Why should one bother with this? One can simply use

      pod2text Module.pm > README

    A problem with doing that is that the default pod2text converter will
    add text to links, so that "L<Module>" is translated to "the Module
    manpage".

    Another problem is that the README includes the entirety of the module
    documentation! Most people browsing the README file do not need all of
    this information.

    Likewise, including installation and requirement information in the
    module documentation is not necessary either, since the module is
    already installed.

    This module allows authors to mark portions of the POD to be included
    only in, or to be excluded from the README file. It also allows you to
    include portions of another file (such as a separate ChangeLog).

    See the module documentation for more details.
